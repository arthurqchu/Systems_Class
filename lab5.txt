(1) A computer with 2^22 bytes of physical memory has 41,494,304 frames.

(2) This computer provides a virtual address space of 2^32 bytes which is 4,294,967,296 bytes, or 4.2950 GB.

(3) From the virtual address 0x0012D687, the system establishes the corresponding physical location by :
        i) Converting the hexadecimal number to decimal: 1234567
        ii)

(6) As the address space grows, the page-table size increases.

(7) As the page size grows, the page-table size decreases.

(8) We shouldn't default to using really big pages because while each page could store more information, the computer wouldn't be able to multi-task and run multiple processes at once as efficiently. It would have to swap out these large page files from RAM to harddrive which is slow.
