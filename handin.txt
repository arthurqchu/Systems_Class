./script1 1 2 script1 ./ >> handin.txt
One (1) line.
Another line.
The first command line argument number is less than the second one.
2 is the second number I was given.
I definitely have that folder around here.
I found the file you mentioned.
Here's what I found in that folder:
./Haskell
./Java-Projects
./Systems_Class
./handin.txt
./script1
./tmpResults.txt
